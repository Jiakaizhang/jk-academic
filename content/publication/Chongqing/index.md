abstract: This paper draws upon a quasi-experiment in China's regional administrative hierarchy to investigate the effect of a city-upgrading policy. This policy upgrades prefecture-level cities to municipalities with the provincial administrative level. Chongqing is the only city recently designated as the municipality in 1997. This paper adopts the synthetic control method and finds that city-upgrading policy increased Chongqing's GDP by more than 40\% on average in the following four years since 1997. In addition, we examine the direct and spillover effects of the municipalities on various aspects, including economic growth, foreign direct investment, urbanization, local government revenue, and productivity.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper explores the relation between input VAT credits carryovers and corporate income tax avoidance behavior.
